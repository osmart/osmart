HOLE is a program that allows the analysis and visualisation of the pore
dimensions of the holes through molecular structures of ion channels

It was written by

while a post doc and independent 
research fellow at Birkbeck College with the assistance of several
students:

Valeriu Niculae and Xiaonan Wang.

The first application of HOLE was to analyse the pore dimensions of gramicidin A

working with Prof.'s

For many years HOLE was hosted by 
http://sbcb.bioch.ox.ac.uk/sansom.php[Prof Mark Sansom] at Oxford. However,
because I was busy doing other things HOLE became unavailable about a year ago.


Although it was written over 20 years ago, HOLE remains in demand and its 
main publications have been cited over 800 times.
